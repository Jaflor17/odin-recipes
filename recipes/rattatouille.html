    <h2> Straight from that Disney Movie</h2>
     <p> Honestly, if it weren’t for that Disney movie about the rat, I doubt my kids would have been so eager to try my ratatouille recipe.</p>
     <p> But once they did, they were delighted and now it’s a dish I love to make when I feel like we should have something meatless. Made with a bounty of fresh, colorful vegetables, you’ll love the garden-fresh flavors in this tasty meal!</p>

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
          <li>Eggplant</li>
          <li>Zucchini</li>
          <li>Roma Tomatoes</li>
          <li>Crushed Tomoatoes</li>
          <li>Carrot</li>
          <li>Garlic</li>
          <li>Cloves</li>
          <li>Onions</li>
          <li>Dried Herbs</li>
          <li>Olive Oil</li>
         </ul>
            <h4> The Anyone can Cook Steps </h4>
         <ol>
          <li>You’ll preheat the oven and meanwhile cook the onion, garlic, and carrot until it’s tender on the stove top.</li>
          <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and seasonings and simmer for about 15 minutes</li>
          <li>Taste at this point to see if the seasoning is balanced, and once the sauce is thick, pour it into your baking dish.</li>
          <li>Now you’ll arrange the slices of vegetables in a pretty circular pattern and brush with olive oil. Cover it and bake until done!</li>
